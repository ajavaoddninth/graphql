GraphQL Code Challenge 

In this repository you'll find starting code for a GraphQL server implementation with a failing unit tests/postman tests.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to update the GraphQL query in postman or update the GraphQL server implementation to make the failing tests pass.

### Running the GraphQL server
To run the GraphQL server, run the following command:
```sh
$ npm install        # this will install the required npm packages 
$ npm start          # this will start the GraphQL server
```
### Accessing the GraphQL server using GraphiQL
Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in your preferred browser.
```sh
http://localhost:<port>/graphql
```
